## Phase coexistence of ice, water and vapour

### Molecular dynamics of ice, water and vapour
In this subproject you will perform MD simulations in Lammps to get a feel for the structure and dynamics of the three phases of water, ice 1h (the common form of ice we all know), liquid water and water vapour. Do the simulation, study the output and include your observations in the report. Try to include both direct observations and what you can infer about entropy and latent heat.

### About the simulations
One key part of this lab, is that you will not run multiple independent Lammps-simulations. Instead, the end of each simulation you run will be used as the starting point for the next. The first simulation you will run is that of ice. After this, you will run a simulation to melt the ice. Before evaporating the ice, you will first have to run a short simulation to expand the simulation cell, before you finally melt the ice.  

### What to observe and measure
1. In all the simulations we want you to observe the visualization and pay attention to the molecular structures and arrangements in the three phases and in the transition between the phases. Describe these in your report.
2. Plot the total energy and enthalpy during the phase transitions and compare the data to your experiments and discuss.
